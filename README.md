Incomplete project at the moment. 

Purpose: Finds different videos (maybe from a tv show), web fetches a description of each title and the cover image associated with that title. Then, it stores the information in a NoSQL database. Based on 3 working directories: Finished, Unfinished, Unsorted. Files in the Unsorted folder will first be sorted into Unfinished. Then if the user chooses, will move that folder to Finished.

Future update: I have an in-home server. I would like to allow my shows to get automatically sorted into a folder on the server based on the title of the show. Right now, sorting is incomplete but it is being worked on.
